# Urban Sound Narrative Generator  

##  What is the project about?  

The **Urban Sound Narrative Generator** transforms **real-world urban audio** into vivid, descriptive narrations — bringing city soundscapes to life through creative storytelling.  

Imagine recording a few seconds of a bustling street and receiving a written narrative that feels straight out of a movie script or a creative journalism piece.

### Example  

**Audio Input:**  
*(30 seconds of recording from a busy street corner)*  

**Detected Sounds:**  
Cars passing, dog barking, children laughing, distant construction drilling, footsteps, and a bicycle bell  

**Generated Output:**  

> The afternoon pulse of the city beats steadily. Cars rush past in waves, their engines humming a familiar urban melody. Somewhere nearby, a dog barks—sharp, insistent—perhaps protesting a passing stranger. Children's laughter bubbles up from the sidewalk, bright and carefree against the mechanical backdrop. In the distance, the rhythmic pounding of construction work reminds everyone that the city is always reinventing itself. A bicycle bell chimes—a polite warning—as a cyclist weaves through the pedestrian flow.

This project acts like a **creative journalist** or **scene setter** for movie scripts — turning ordinary urban sounds into **engaging, atmospheric narratives**.
